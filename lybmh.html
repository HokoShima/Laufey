<center><pre>   Feeling kind of sick tonight
    All I've had is coffee and leftover pie
    It's no wonder why
    Ooh, still you take up all my mind
    I don't even think that you care like I do
    I should stop, heaven knows I've tried
    One day, I will stop falling in love with you
    Some day, someone will like me like I like you
    Until then, I'll drink my coffee, eat my pie
    Pretend that we are more than friends
    Then of course I'll let you break my heart again
    I'm just tryna understand
    What I am to you
    More than songs we've exchanged
    Midnight calls
    Sunset views
    Promise I don't mean to cry
    But I get overwhelmed and confused
    If only you knew
    What I felt like
    One day, I will stop falling in love with you
    Some day, someone will like me like I like you
    Until then, I'll drink my coffee, eat my pie
    Pretend that we are more than friends
    Then of course I'll let you break my heart again
    Some day, one day
    I will stop falling in love with you
    Until I do
    I'll be thinking of you
    Let you break my heart again</pre></center>
