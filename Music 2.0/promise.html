<center><pre>   I made a promise
    To distance myself
    Took a flight, through aurora skies
    Honestly, I didn't think about
    How we didn't say goodbye
    Just see you very soon
    It hurts to be something
    It's worse to be nothing with you, mmm
    So I didn't call you
    For sixteen long days
    And I should get a cigarette
    For so much restraint
    No matter how long I resist temptation
    I will always lose
    It hurts to be something
    It's worse to be nothing with you
    I've done the math
    There's no solution
    We'll never last
    Why can't I let go of this?
    So I broke my promise
    I called you last night
    I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have
    If it weren't for the sight of a boy
    Who looked just like you
    Standing out on Melrose Avenue
    It hurts to be something
    It's worse to be nothing with you, mmm
    It hurts to be something
    It's worse to be nothing with you</pre></center>
