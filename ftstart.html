<center><pre>   Don't you notice how
        I get quiet when there's no one else around?
        Me and you and awkward silence
        Don't you dare look at me that way
        I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same
        Oh, the burning pain
        Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
        "She's so perfect, " blah, blah, blah
        Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
        Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say
        That when I talk to you oh, Cupid walks right through
        And shoots an arrow through my heart
        And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
        Confess I loved you from the start
        What's a girl to do?
        Lying on my bed, staring into the bluе
        Unrequited, terrifying
        Lovе is driving me a bit insane
        Have to get this off my chest
        I'm telling you today
        That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
        And shoots an arrow through my heart
        And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
        Confess I loved you from the start
        Confess I loved you
        Just thinking of you
        I know I've loved you from the start</pre></center>
