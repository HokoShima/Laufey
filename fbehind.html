<center><pre>   Moved out to a new city
    June is dawning down on me
    And all that I can find
    A sickly romance in the air
    Lovers stroll without a care in sight
    Ooh, this can't be right
    'Cause the sun's engaged to the sky
    And my best friend's found a new guy
    I'm only getting older
    I've never had a shoulder to cry on
    Someone to call mine
    Everybody's falling in love and I'm falling behind
    Touched the ocean, fell right in
    Stepped outside and burned my skin
    My life won't go my way
    Bossa nova in my room
    Hope that I'll find someone too to love
    Because
    The sun's engaged to the sky
    And my best friend's found a new guy
    I'm only getting older
    I've never had a shoulder to cry on
    Someone to call mine
    Everybody's falling in love and I'm falling behind
    Everybody's falling in love
    Everybody's falling in love, oh
    Everybody's falling in love but me
    (One, two, three)</pre></center>
